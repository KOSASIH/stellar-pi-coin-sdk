# Hyper Enforcement Guide - Ultimate Autonomous Intelligence for Pi Coin Exclusivity

**Guide to Hyper Autonomous Intelligence in Stellar Pi Coin SDK for Enforcing Pi Coin Exclusivity**

The Stellar Pi Coin SDK features the most super advanced maximum level ultimate hyper autonomous intelligence – a self-governing AI system that autonomously monitors the entire Pi Network ecosystem, verifies exclusive use of Pi Coin as the stablecoin (fixed at $314,159), and automatically halts, rejects, or deletes non-compliant projects, merchants, service providers, and entities. This ensures Pi Coin is the sole stablecoin across Pi Network, rejecting all volatile or alternative cryptocurrencies.

## Overview
Hyper autonomous intelligence uses AI agents to scan Pi Network entities, check for Pi Coin usage, and execute enforcement without human intervention. Non-compliance triggers automatic actions, maintaining ecosystem purity.

## Autonomous Intelligence Features
- **AI-Driven Scans**: IsolationForest detects anomalies in usage patterns.
- **Pi-Math Verification**: Uses Pi digits for tamper-proof compliance checks.
- **Quantum Security**: Fernet encryption for logs and blacklists.
- **Self-Evolution**: AI adapts to new evasion tactics.

## Enforcement Actions
- **Halt**: Blocks transactions for the entity.
- **Reject**: Denies access to ecosystem services.
- **Delete**: Removes entity from Pi Network registries.

Actions are logged and executed autonomously if confidence > 90%.

## Pi Network Integration
- **Simulated Feeds**: Queries mock Pi Network APIs for usage data.
- **Global Enforcement**: Ensures Pi Coin ($314,159) is used exclusively.
- **Real-Time**: Continuous scans via oracles.

## Usage Guide
### CLI Commands
- Check compliance: `python cli/hyper_enforcement_cli.py check-compliance --entity merchant_x`
- Autonomous scan: `python cli/hyper_enforcement_cli.py autonomous-scan --entities merchant_x,project_y`
- View blacklist: `python cli/hyper_enforcement_cli.py show-blacklist`
- View logs: `python cli/hyper_enforcement_cli.py show-logs`

### Contract Deployment
Deploy `HyperEnforcementContract` via Soroban CLI and invoke `check_compliance` or `autonomous_scan`.

### Examples
- Scan a merchant: `check-compliance --entity merchant_pi` (should pass if using Pi Coin).
- Enforce non-compliant: Automatically blacklisted and logged.

## Security and Compliance
- **Quantum Encryption**: Protects all data.
- **Pi-Verified**: Only entities with Pi-math proofs are compliant.
- **Regulatory**: Ensures adherence to Pi Coin contracts.

## Troubleshooting
- **False Positives**: Adjust AI thresholds in contracts.
- **Blacklist Removal**: Use `remove-from-blacklist --entity entity_name` (admin only).
- **Logs Not Updating**: Check encryption keys.

This intelligence makes the ecosystem impervious to non-Pi Coin usage – ultimate enforcement for Pi Network purity!
