# Pi Coin Hyper Stablecoin: Overview and Relationship to Pi Network

## Introduction
Pi Coin is an independent, hyper-tech stablecoin project built on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts. It features a fixed peg to $314,159 (π-based), total supply of 100 billion units, and symbol "PI". Designed with advanced technologies like quantum-resistant cryptography, AI-enhanced oracles, ZKP anti-fraud, and exclusive provenance tracking, Pi Coin aims to empower global society through unmatched stability and security. **The $314,159 peg applies only to Pi Coin from approved sources: Mining, Rewards, or P2P—other sources are automatically rejected from the Pi Ecosystem**.

## Key Features
- **Fixed Peg to $314,159**: Stable collateral-backed value, exclusive to valid sources (Mining/Rewards/P2P). Invalid sources are blocked to maintain purity.
- **Quantum-Resistant Security**: Ed25519 signatures, SHA-256 hashes, and ZKP for forgery prevention.
- **AI-Enhanced Oracles**: Predictive price feeds with ML simulations for global market stability.
- **Provenance Tracking**: Tracks token origin per holder, ensuring exclusive ecosystem entry.
- **Quantum-Secure Governance**: Multi-signature voting restricted to valid sources.
- **Global Payment Recognition**: Stellar DEX integration, cross-chain bridging, and worldwide adoption simulations.
- **Unmatched Integrity**: Cannot be imitated, forged, or altered—with autonomous AI enforcement.

## Technical Architecture
Pi Coin consists of modular smart contracts and autonomous scripts:
- **Core Contracts**: pi_coin_contract.rs (main logic), pi_coin_oracle.rs (AI oracles), pi_coin_governance.rs (voting).
- **Utilities**: pi_coin_utils.rs (π calculations, provenance checks).
- **Autonomous Systems**: Scripts like hyper_ai_monitor.rs (real-time enforcement), global_adoption_booster.rs (campaigns), pi_coin_api.rs (endpoints), pi_coin_dashboard.rs (visualization), pi_coin_self_replicator.rs (expansion), pi_coin_ultimate_enforcer.rs (orchestration), pi_coin_final_deployer.rs (launch).
- **CI/CD**: Hyper-tech pipeline for build, test, and deploy with AI decisions and quantum verification.
- **Blockchain Base**: Stellar Soroban for live, global mainnet deployment.

## Relationship to Pi Network
Pi Coin is **completely independent** from Pi Network and has no official affiliation. Pi Network is a mobile app-based project focused on referral mining and community building, without its own blockchain or smart contracts. Pi Coin draws inspiration from Pi Network's vision of decentralized currency but implements it as a standalone stablecoin on Stellar.

### Key Differences
- **Blockchain**: Pi Network has no blockchain; Pi Coin uses Stellar's live mainnet.
- **Technology**: Pi Network relies on app-based simulation; Pi Coin uses hyper-tech smart contracts with AI, quantum security, and provenance.
- **Peg and Supply**: Pi Network's Pi is not pegged; Pi Coin has a fixed $314,159 peg with controlled supply.
- **Ecosystem**: Pi Coin enforces exclusive sources (Mining/Rewards/P2P); Pi Network is open to all participants.
- **Governance**: Pi Coin has quantum-secure voting; Pi Network uses community consensus without code.

### Inspiration and No Affiliation
Pi Coin is inspired by Pi Network's goal of accessible cryptocurrency but is a separate project. It does not share code, tokens, or infrastructure with Pi Network. Users interested in Pi Network should refer to the official Pi app (minepi.com), while Pi Coin offers an advanced stablecoin alternative on Stellar.

## Use Cases
- **Stable Payments**: Global transactions with fixed value, ideal for cross-border transfers.
- **DeFi Integration**: Lending, staking, and DEX trading on Stellar.
- **Exclusive Rewards**: Incentives for valid source holders (Mining/Rewards/P2P).
- **AI-Driven Stability**: Autonomous adjustments for market volatility.

## Risks and Considerations
- **Experimental**: As a new project, test on Stellar testnet first.
- **Regulatory**: Stablecoins may face scrutiny; consult legal experts.
- **Independence**: No connection to Pi Network—avoid confusion in promotions.
- **Security**: Quantum-resistant, but users should secure wallets.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/pi-coin-hyper-stablecoin.git`
2. Build: `cargo build --release`
3. Test: `cargo test`
4. Deploy (manual): Use stellar-cli for testnet/mainnet.

## Community and Support
- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or suggest features.
- **Discord/Stellar Forums**: Discuss with the Stellar community.
- **Disclaimer**: This is not financial advice. Pi Coin is independent from Pi Network.
